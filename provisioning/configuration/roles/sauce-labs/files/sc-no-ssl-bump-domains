# > network components, such as browsers and servers that use WebSockets, won't
# > work if the traffic to them has been altered, which Sauce Connect appears
# > to do. [...] You can disable SSL bumping by using the `-B` /
# > `--no-ssl-bump-domains` argument when you start Sauce Connect and
# > specifying which domains should not be bumped or specify all so that all
# > domains that passed through the tunnel are not bumped .
